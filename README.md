-Intake Rollers: 2 motors (200RPM) spinning opposite direction
-Magazine: 1 motor (200RPM) for opening/closing choocher


All motors should have their at laest the following characteristic's monitored: voltage, current, power*, velocity, torque*
*calculated values

PROS might have built it functions for all of those (as does VEX Coding Studio).

Those characteristics should be logged and saved to an SD card inserted in the brain's SD card slot. 

In addition, the program should be able to make decisions based on those characteristics.

Readme to be updated with more information when available.
